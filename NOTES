* Opening a Database

All database operations are performed on an open database, which is represented
by a database handle.

Here's an example:

#+begin_src c
  rc = tsdb_open(path,
                 &handler,
                 &num_values_per_entry,
                 rrd_slot_time_duration,
                 read_only)
#+end_src

path is the path to the database.

handler is the reference to the database. This can be use in subsequent calls.

num_values_per_entry specifies the number of values per entry when the database
is created. If the database already exists, it's set to the number used when
the database was created. Once set, it cannot be changed.

rrd_slot_time_duration specifies the number of seconds per time slot. E.g. a
value of 60 means that each slot in the database covers 60 seconds.

* Setting the Current Epoch

Use tsdb_goto_epoch to set the current epoch. This is used to read time series
per key using tsdb_get.

If load_on_demand is set to 1, the operation will always succeed. If set to 0,
the operation will fail if the epoch doesn't exist.

This operation has the substantial side effect of loading all of the time
series for that specified epoch into memory. As time series are stored in one
or more compressed fragments, this operation is not cheap.

The advantage is that all of the time series for the epoch are available via a
quick mapping of key to index offset.

* Setting Values

There are three operations involved in setting time series values:

- Open a database (tsdb_open)
- Go to an epoch (tsdb_goto_epoch)
- Set the value (tsdb_set)

* Questions

** load_page_on_demand

When using load_page_on_demand=1 in tsdb_goto_epoch, map_raw_get always
fails. For the time being, using load_page_on_demand=0.

** Missing Values

The default_unknown_value for a handler is used as the resp in tsdb_get as
expected, but tsdb_get returns -1, suggesting that the get failed. Is -1
explicitly different from a general error, indicating that the default value
was used? It seems to me that default value might not be needed, if we can
infer that -1 mean "not set".

** Multiple Values

What are some use cases for storing more than one value per key per slot?
E.g. I could see this for double precision values.

** Open API Inconsistencies

The open API is a bit odd I think:

- On create num_values_per_entry and rrd_slot_time_duration are both sensibly
  used to initialize the database

- On open, num_values_per_entry is ignored as input and is instread written to
  as an output variable, however rrd_slot_time_duration is neither read as
  input nor written to as output

I'd expect something like this:

- Both args are used as input/output

- There's some indication as to whether or not the db was created or not

Or

- Both args are only input and are ignored on open

- User needs to read from the handler to get the real values
* To Do

** Refactor map_raw_key_exists

It's arguably a nit but why doesn't this use DB->exists?

Would look something like this:

#+begin_src c
  static int map_raw_key_exists(tsdb_handler *handler,
                                void *key, u_int32_t key_len) {
    DBT key_data;
    key_data.data = key;
    key_data.size = key_len;

    if (handler->db->exists(handler->db, NULL, &key_data, 0) == DB_NOTFOUND) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return 1;
    }
  }
#+end_src

** Multiple index maps pointless

There's incomplete support for multiple index maps. It looks like only one
index map is every used.

I'm not sure what the idea was behind multiple indexes. Maybe this was the
auto-expire feature talked about.

You can drop a key for values before a specific epoch value. E.g.

  tsdb_drop_key(&db, key, expire_at);

The implementation loops through available maps and expires the first map whos
epoch_end is 0 (the default value when the index is created).

However, it's impossible to have more than one index map.

The refactor should be to either implement the correct multi-map support, or
drop any logic that iterates over multiple maps, as there can only ever be one.
